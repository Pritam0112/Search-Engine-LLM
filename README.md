# Search Engine LLM

## Overview

This project demonstrates a search engine application utilizing a Language Model (LLM) integrated with various sources of information. The application leverages `StreamlitCallbackHandler` to display the thoughts and actions of an AI agent interactively. The primary components include integration with Wikipedia, Arxiv, and DuckDuckGo for comprehensive search capabilities.

## Project Description

The `Search Engine LLM` app showcases the use of advanced generative AI techniques for building an interactive search engine. Developed as part of a learning journey into Generative AI, this project highlights the integration of a powerful LLM with real-time search tools. The app allows users to query a range of sources and interact with an AI-driven chatbot that can provide detailed information based on user input.

### Features

- **Integration with Multiple Search Tools**: Uses DuckDuckGo, Wikipedia, and Arxiv to provide diverse search results.
- **Interactive Chatbot**: Displays AI-generated responses and real-time search results.

## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: Framework for building the interactive web application.
- **LangChain**: Toolset for integrating language models and search capabilities.
- **Groq API**: Provides access to the language model used in the application.
- **Arxiv API**: Accesses academic papers and research articles.
- **Wikipedia API**: Retrieves information from Wikipedia.
- **DuckDuckGo API**: Enables web searches for additional information.

## Usage

- **Enter your Groq API Key**: Provide your API key in the sidebar settings to access the language model.
- **Interact with the Chatbot**: Type your queries into the chat input box to receive responses from the AI-driven search engine.

## Learnings

This project was developed while learning Generative AI and showcases the practical application of language models in building interactive search tools. It provides insights into integrating multiple data sources and enhancing user interaction through AI-driven responses.
